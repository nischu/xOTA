    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
    Toilets on the Air (TOTA) is intended as an amateur radio activity during 38C3.<br>Use amateur radio to activate "references" just like you would for other xOTA programs like Parks on the Air (POTA), Summits on the Air (SOTA), Island on the Air (IOTA), …
    In this case, the references are just toilets.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="centers">Activity centers:</a></h3>

    <h3><a id="terms">Terminology:</a></h3>
    <dl class="row">
       <dt>Activator</dt>
       <dd>Person who activates a reference (in this case toilet). Only the activator needs to log QSOs in this system.</dd>

       <dt>Chaser</dt>
       <dd>See hunter.</dd>
       <dt>Hunter</dt>
       <dd>QSO partner of the activator. A hunter is not required to be at a reference. Hunters don't need to log hunter QSOs unless they are also an activator (see T2T). They receive hunter credit automatically, if they have an account and the activator logs their QSO.</dd>
       <dt>RST</dt>
       <dd>System used by amateur radio operators to exchange information about the quality of their signal. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system" target="_blank">Wikipedia R-S-T System</a>.</dd>
